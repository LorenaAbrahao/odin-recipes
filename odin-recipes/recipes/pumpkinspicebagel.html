    <H2>Ingredients</H2>
        <ul>- 1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast</ul>
        <ul>- ⅔ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</ul>
        <ul>- ¾ cup canned pumpkin</ul>
        <ul>- ⅓ cup packed brown sugar</ul>
        <ul>- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</ul>
        <ul>- 1 teaspoon salt</ul>
        <ul>- ¾ teaspoon ground nutmeg</ul>
        <ul>- ½ teaspoon ground allspice</ul>
        <ul>- ½ teaspoon ground cloves</ul>
        <ul>- 3 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</ul>
        <ul>- 1 tablespoon cornmeal</ul>
        <ul>- 6 cups water, or more as needed</ul>
        <ul>- 1 teaspoon white sugar</ul>
        <ul>- cooking spray</ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>Step 1: Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl; add pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves and mix well. Stir in enough flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough onto a work surface and knead by hand 6 to 8 minutes or mix in a stand mixer. Transfer dough to a greased bowl, cover with a damp towel, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</ol>
        <ol>Step 2: Punch dough down and divide into 8 balls. Poke a hole in the middle of each ball using your finger to create a bagel shape. Arrange bagels on a baking sheet and let rise, 10 to 15 minutes. </ol>
        <ol>Step 3: Fill a large pot with 6 cups water and white sugar and bring to a boil. Slightly flatten the bagels and drop a couple at a time into the boiling water; cook for 1 1/2 minutes. Flip bagels and boil for another 1 1/2 minutes; remove with a slotted spoon and dry on a clean towel. Repeat with remaining bagels.</ol>
        <ol>Step 4: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and sprinkle cornmeal on the sheet. Arrange bagels on the baking sheet about 2 inches apart. </ol>
        <ol>Step 5: Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, 25 to 30 minutes.</ol>


    <h2>Cook's Note</h2>
        <p>This can also be made in a bread machine on the dough cycle. The only adjustments are to use 70 degree F (21 degrees C) water, and check the dough after 5 minutes to make sure the dough is the correct consistency (add water or flour accordingly). After it has risen continue on with step 2 (forming the bagels).</p>
