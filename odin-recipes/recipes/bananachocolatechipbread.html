        <ul>- <strong>Flour:</strong> This chocolate chip banana bread starts with all-purpose flour.</ul>
        <ul>- <strong>Leaveners:</strong> Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</ul>

        <ul>- <strong>Bananas:</strong> You'll need to mash three ripe bananas.</ul>
        <ul>- <strong>Milk:</strong> A tablespoon of milk adds moisture.</ul>
        <ul>- <strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Ground cinnamon lends welcome warmth.</ul>
        <ul>- <strong>Sugar: </strong>This recipe calls for white sugar, but some Allrecipes community members like to use a blend of brown and white sugars.</ul>
        <ul>- <strong>Eggs: </strong>Whole eggs keep the banana bread moist and help bind the batter together.</ul>
        <ul>- <strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> Of course, you'll need chocolate chips!</ul>
